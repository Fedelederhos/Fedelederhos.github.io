                        My experience participating in the National Congress of Information Technology and Information Systems (CoNaIISI) was both as a technical organizer and project presenter.
                        From my role as a technical, I am grateful to the Systems Department of the National Technological University, Regional Faculty of Concepcion del Uruguay and the different teachers who invited me and worked to make it happen in the best way.
                        As for my role as a presenter, despite it being my first presentation, the experience was very enriching, the good criticism from the listeners and those close to me leaves me calm and eager to have more opportunities.

                        Participating in the Database Investigation Group (GIBD) at the National Technological University, Regional Faculty of Concepcion del Uruguay, specifically in Similarity Searches using Artificial Intelligence Techniques, was a very wise decision in order to start approaching real problems, challenges and projects. Particularly during my time in the group, I focused on the development of Feature Extraction using Siamese Networks and Augmentation applied to Brand Similarity Searches in conjunction with the project director, Andrés J. Pascal.

                        In a 28-hour time period, 8000 students and teachers from different universities gathered to develop a solution to various challenges.
                        My team was composed of students from Mendoza, Cordoba, Buenos Aires and Chaco. Together, we chose the "Water for Dreams" challenge and developed a solution of which we are very satisfied with the results obtained.
                        In its first stage, the solution would create a communal filtering system and storage in a water tank suitable for consumption, providing data to users through messages, and in a final instance a similar system implemented in each household. It would have 4 rainwater collection points that would have their own filters located in an outdoor park, these points would be three-layer physical filters, which would channel the filtered water to a tank, which would have an arduino, powered by solar panels, previously prepared to measure the volume of the tank, its chlorine concentration and electrical conductivity.
